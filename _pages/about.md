Hi there! I'm a student of the master's in Economics program at the University of Bonn. I am keenly interested in empirical economics and causal inferences with the aid of reliable econometric and
fun computational methods. I have previously interned at the Max Planck Institute in Bonn and at a fast-paced economics consulting firm in Berlin.
