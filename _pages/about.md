Hi there! I'm a student of the master's in Economics program at the University of Bonn. I am keenly interested in empirical economics and causal inferences with the aid of reliable econometric and
fun computational methods. I have previously interned at the Max Planck Institute in Bonn and in a reputed Economics consulting firm in Berlin.


**What piques my interest?**
* Discovering new data sets to play with!
* New tools in R.
* Casual inference and it's interaction with machine learning.
* Fun new Stata packages.
* Developmental/Experimental economics.
* New updates in competition enforcement.
